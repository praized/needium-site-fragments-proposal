Sometime in the summer of 2006, the company’s co-founders got together for the first time to discuss the possibility of launching a startup. 
They were very excited about media becoming social and the quantity of local content being created in this new space. 
They thought there was an interesting business to build at the intersection of local search and local conversations happening on the internet. Turns out they were right.

Social media is now a mass-market. Millions of consumers are sharing activities and opinions about local businesses using Twitter and/or Facebook.

They are also expressing needs such as “I’m hungry”, “My car just broke down” and “Does anyone have a dentist to recommend?”, even in smaller cities. Needium takes a different view of how to leverage the social web, focusing on lead generation for small and medium businesses.

Needium was first made available in Montreal in July 2010 and is now available in major cities across North America and Europe. We think we’ve stumbled upon the future of word-of-mouth marketing and have many exciting ideas about where this is going. You can keep up with us [@NeediumHQ](http://www.twitter.com/neediumhq) and on our corporate blog.
